### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am **Matthew Rungwe**, a JavaScript Developer. My focus is on the Front-End part of web development where I design and develop solutions that help others solve their problems. 

My strengths lie in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript as the *core* and *fundamental* aspects of all my web applications. To improve effeciency, consistency, maintanability and scalability of my web apps, I have learned to employ Angular and React into my development.

Besides coding, I spend a good part of my time Mentoring Front-End devlopers, blogging, creating tutorial content, learning new technologies, upskilling and reading the Bible.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: Mentoring other young upcoming Web Developer, creating content, projects and blogging.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Upskilling in Back-End Development and other technologies relavent to my stack.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: Anything Education. I love education and working on projects that can allow us to improve the way we pass down information to the next generation

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: opportunities to build things that matter, to show what I can do and to grow.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

- âš¡ Fun fact: Coding is not a career in itself but rather a steping stone to help you bring to life your creative ideas.
